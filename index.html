					<p>
						I'm an 18 year old French girl but carried out all of my studies in England. I have 4 siblings, 2 parents and 2 pretty extraordinary dogs ( in no particular order). The way I stay sane usually revolves around my dogs and my CrossFit. This is the end of my first year at ESSEC and I hope it leads to me working in the Luxury sector.

				<h2><strong>Dog Training</strong></h2>
					<p>
						I enjoy dog training because it is the most fulfilling and satisfactory activity I have ever partaken in and is incredible for my mental health ( highly recommend it ).

				<h2><strong>Criminology</strong></h2>
					<p>
						I've been interested in criminology and understanding the patterns and sources of criminal behaviour since my childhood, it's something that never ends to fascinate me and I believe that changing parts of our legal system accordingly could hugely benefit our society.

				<h2><strong>Taste test Caipirinhas</strong></h2>
					<p>
						I'm not much of a drinker but Caipirinhas are ( in my humble opinion) the best cocktail on the market and   I have this odd conviction that when I taste the ultimate one I will know and can then learn how to recreate it - exactly, after which I can die happy.
